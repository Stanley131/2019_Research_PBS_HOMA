1. What is HOMA trying to do?
    Homa is a transport protocol for datacenter networks. Its goal to
    achieve low latency, especially for workloads with high volume
    of vert short message.

2. How to implement it?
    Homa uses in-network priority queues to ensure low latency for
    short messages; priority allocation is managed daynamically by
    each receiver and integrated with a receiver-driven flow control
    mechanism. Also, Homa uses controlled overcommitment of receiver
    downlinks to ensure efficient bandwidth utilization at high
    load.
