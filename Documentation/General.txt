###Seven Layers
1. Physical Layer:
2. Data Link: data packets aare encoded and decoded into bits.
3. Networl: Switching and Routing, creating logical path, known as
        virtual circuits, for transmitting data from node to node.
4. Transport: Provides transparent transfer of data between end syste-
        ms, or hosts, and is responsible for end-to-end recovery and
        flow control. TCP, UDP
5. Session: Establish, manage and terminate connections between
        applications. The session layer sets up, coordinates, and temi-
        nates conversations,..
6. Presentation: Provide different ideas of data representations(e.g.
        encryption)
7. Application: WWW, FTP, SNMP


### The RPC Model
    The remote procedure call model is similar to that of the local model,
    which works as follows:

    The caller places arguments to a procedure in a specific location
    (such as a result register).

    The caller temporarily transfers control to the procedure.
    When the caller gains control again, it obtains the results
    of the procedure from the specified location.

    The caller then continues program execution.
